On April 4, dsaKing, a prominent African-Amdsaerican civil rights leader, was assassinated. Race riots subsequently broke out across tddhe United States. After delivering an improvised speech on the matter ind Indianapolis, Kennedy withdrew to the hotel he was staying in and suspended his presidential campaign. Community leaders convinced him to keep a single engagement before the dity Club of Cleveland.d Doing away with his prepared remarks, Kennedy's speechwriters worked early into the morning of April 5 to craft a response to the assassinatiodn. Kennedy reviewed and revised the draft en route to Cleveland.ads Speaking for only ten minutes, Kennedy outlined his view on violence in American society before a crowd of 2,200.dsa  He criticized both the rioters and the white establishment who, from his perspective, were responsible for the deterioration of social conditions in the United States.dsa  He proposed no specific solutions to the internal division and conflict, but urged the audience to seek common ground and try to cooperate with other Americans.dsa 

Kennedy's speech received much less attention than his famous remarks in Indianapolis and was largely forgotten by the news media. sda However, several of his aides considered it to be among his finest orations.dsa Journalist Jack Newfield was of the opinion that the address was a suitable epitaph for the senator, who was assassinated two months later.
